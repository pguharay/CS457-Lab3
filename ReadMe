How to make - 
Run make clean to clear the build. 
Run make all to build the project.

How to run - 
Execute myresolver <host name> to resolve a hostname to IPV6 RR (AAAA)
along with RRSIG RR when present. If AAAA and RRSIG RR is not present 
CNAME RR will be displayed for the hostname.

Callflow and collaboration - 
1. dns_client.cc is the command line interface. It accepts the hostname and validates the same using 
   query processor API. dns_client.cc maintains a list of known root servers to start the query chain.
2. dns_client.cc invokes query processor API to prepare a DNS query with hostname being passed from
   command line. dns_client passes on the formatted DNS query structure to udpclient.cc. 
3. udpclient sends the request packet to target name server and polls for response. Once the response
   is received, response buffer is passed to response_reader API for parsing and structural formating.
4. Response reader does the parsing and creates the response structural elements. Response reader uses 
   the codec API to perform Base64 encoding on RRSIG signature if present.This structural elements are
   returned back to dns_client for response rendering.
